# WisWork

An AI-native office suite for macOS and Windows: word processor, spreadsheet,
presentations, and PDF — five Electron apps sharing one engine layer, built
around AI editing as a first-class workflow rather than a bolted-on chat box.

WisWork release artifacts are published through the AtomInnoLab release pipeline.

## Apps

| App           | Product            | What it is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apps/docs`   | **WisWork Docs**   | `.docx` word processor. Byte-preserving round trip: only dirty paragraphs are regenerated (paragraph patch), everything else in the original file is kept byte-for-byte, so opening and saving never breaks layout in Word. Paginated view whose line metrics reproduce the original document's layout, tracked changes, comments, styles, equations, ink. |
| `apps/sheets` | **WisWork Sheets** | `.xlsx` spreadsheet. UI built on the open-source [Univer](https://github.com/dream-num/univer) core (Apache-2.0) with a large layer of in-house extensions; xlsx import/export runs through an in-house Rust sidecar (calamine + IronCalc), charts are rendered in-house (Konva), plus pivot tables, slicers, conditional formatting, and formula tracing. |
| `apps/slides` | **WisWork Slides** | `.pptx` presentations. In-house pptx parse/render/edit engine with masters, charts, cropping, ink, and text shaping (HarfBuzz metrics).                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `apps/pdf`    | **WisWork PDF**    | PDF viewer/editor on pdf.js + pdf-lib: annotations, forms, outlines, stamps, signatures, page operations, print.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `apps/shell`  | **WisWork**        | The suite shell: home screen, tabbed hosting of the four editors, auto-update.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Every app embeds the same AI panel: block-granular AI editing with version
snapshots and diffs in docs, a tool-calling agent over workbook/slide/PDF
state in the others.

**AI service.** The desktop apps authenticate with WisPaper and send model requests through the WisModel-compatible proxy. The service key is read only by the Electron main process from the environment and is never exposed to renderers or stored in project files.

## Engine packages

All pure TypeScript, no Electron dependency, unit-tested (except the UI kit):

- `packages/docx-engine` — docx parsing → block tree (with `docxIndex`
  anchors and passthrough), OOXML fragment generation, byte-level paragraph
  patching.
- `packages/pptx-engine` / `packages/pptx-render` — pptx model and rendering.
- `packages/file-parse` — text extraction for AI attachments (office formats,
  text formats).
- `packages/agent-core` — the AI agent loop and skill composition shared by
  every app.
- `packages/ai-provider` — provider abstraction and streaming for the model
  backends.
- `packages/auth` — WisPaper OAuth, encrypted session storage, refresh, and Electron lifecycle integration.
- `packages/ai-search` — web/image search tools.
- `packages/i18n`, `packages/ui`, `packages/project-store`,
  `packages/electron-utils` — shared i18n core, React UI kit, recent-files
  store, and Electron main-process helpers.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run fixtures     # generate test .docx fixtures
npm test             # engine + app unit tests (docs/sheets/slides need no display)
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit across every workspace
npm run dev          # all four editors + shell against Vite dev servers
npm run dev:docs     # a single app (same pattern works per workspace)
npm run dist:mac     # package macOS dmg (regenerates third-party notices)
npm run dist:win     # package Windows nsis installer
```

The sheets app additionally needs a Rust toolchain for its xlsx sidecar
(`cargo` on PATH); `npm run build -w @wiswork/sheets` compiles it
automatically.

Local UI/e2e driver scripts (Playwright + Electron, for local acceptance, not
committed by default) live in [`scripts/drivers/`](scripts/drivers/README.md).

## Architecture notes (docx round trip)

```
open docx ─► archive original by hash (never touched)
          ─► docx-engine parses word/document.xml top-level elements (w:p / w:tbl / …)
          ─► Block tree, each block anchored by docxIndex + original XML slice
          ─► TipTap streaming editor (manual + AI editing, dirty tracking)
save      ─► dirty blocks → OOXML fragments (referencing existing styles only)
          ─► splice into original document.xml (untouched blocks keep original bytes)
          ─► repack zip; all other entries copied byte-for-byte
```

The same philosophy holds in sheets and slides: the original file is the
source of truth, edits are applied as narrow patches, and everything the
editor didn't touch survives the round trip untouched.

## Security

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the process security posture (renderer
sandboxing, IPC validation, external-link gating) and the threat models for
AI-generated content.

## Third-party notices

`npm run notices` regenerates the bundled third-party license summary
(`tools/gen-third-party-notices.mjs`); all runtime dependencies are
MIT/Apache-2.0/OFL, and the bundled fonts (Liberation, Carlito, Caladea, Noto
CJK subsets) are OFL/Apache.
